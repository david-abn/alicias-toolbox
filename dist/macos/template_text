# How to Use
Hi and welcome!

You can modify anything in this file. This includes the wording under `## Template` or under any other section.

If you would like to add a new section, you can add it to this file.
1. Add a new section by creating a heading beginning with `## `, e.g. `## New Section`.
2. Add the options to the newly added section in this format: 
1: This is some sample text
b: We can use whatever we want on the left of the semicolon; note it says "b".
3. Update the text under the `## Template` section to include the newly created section.
This might look something like: This is my new section {New Section}
4. Save the file and run Alicia's Toolbox.

For new versions:
